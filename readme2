Creative Ideas Platform - System Design

## Functional Requirements

- Submit Ideas
  Contributors submit creative ideas.

- Full-Text Search
  Search ideas by title/content using fuzzy logic via Elasticsearch.

- Filter/Search
  Filter by domain, tags, author, score, and other metadata.

- Feedback
  Users can comment and like ideas.

- Popularity Engine
  Sort/search ideas by a popularity score (likes + age factor).

- Missing Info Filter
  Find ideas missing tags or descriptions.

- Admin Dashboard
  Analytics for top contributors, most used tags, popular ideas.

- Idea Drafting
  Save in-progress ideas with status = DRAFT.

- Collaboration Support (New)
  Allow multiple users to co-author or contribute to the same idea.

- Tag Suggestion System (New)
  Auto-suggest relevant tags based on idea content using NLP.

- Notification System (New)
  Notify users of likes, comments, similar idea submissions, or updates.

- Idea Versioning / History (New)
  Maintain change history for each idea (drafts and published versions).

- Gamification & Recognition (New)
  Award badges or points for active or high-quality contributions.

- Duplicate Detection (New)
  Prevent similar idea spam by detecting and alerting on content similarity.

- Approval Workflow (New - Optional)
  Admin/moderator review before ideas are publicly published.

- Export/Share Feature (New)
  Enable idea sharing via PDF, social media, or email.

- Analytics per Idea (New)
  Track detailed idea metrics (views, likes, comments over time).


## Non-Functional Requirements

- RESTful API
  Follow REST principles for all endpoints.

- Secure Endpoints
  Use JWT + Spring Security for authentication and role-based authorization.

- Scalable
  Elasticsearch for scalable search, and database schema for relational mapping.

- Modular, Clean Structure
  Maintain separation of concerns across modules (API, DB, search, auth, etc.).

- Well Documented & Testable
  Swagger/OpenAPI for docs; JUnit/TestContainers for automated testing.

- Caching Layer (New)
  Use Redis or similar to cache frequent queries and boost performance.

- API Rate Limiting & Monitoring (New)
  Prevent abuse with throttling; monitor usage with Prometheus/Grafana.

- Logging & Observability (New)
  Use ELK stack or similar for centralized logging and error tracing.

- CI/CD Support (New)
  Integrate Jenkins/GitHub Actions for automated testing, building, and deployment.

- Localization & i18n (New)
  Support multi-language interfaces for broader accessibility.

- Accessibility (WCAG) (New)
  Ensure UI is compliant with accessibility standards.

- Data Retention Policy (New)
  Define storage limits and auto-deletion rules for old data.

- Backup & Disaster Recovery (New)
  Scheduled backups and recovery strategy for data protection.


## API Flow

- Store Searchable Content
  Use Elasticsearch for indexing and full-text search.

- Store Relational Metadata
  Use MySQL for user profiles, roles, idea metadata, analytics.

- Store Feedback Threads
  Use MongoDB or MySQL for comments and feedback data.

- Unify API Layer
  Spring Boot exposes unified, secure REST APIs.

- Dynamic ES DSL Queries
  Dynamically construct and execute Elasticsearch queries for filters and fuzzy logic.

- Caching Layer (New)
  Redis used to cache trending/popular ideas, frequent searches, and dashboard data.

- Notification Engine (New)
  Use event-driven architecture (e.g., RabbitMQ/Kafka) for async notifications.
